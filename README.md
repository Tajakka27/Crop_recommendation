# Crop Type Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python machine learning project that classifies crop types based on soil and environmental parameters. It leverages multiple classification algorithms and evaluates their performance to identify the best model for accurate crop prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 2200 entries with the following features:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
- Crop label (target)

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  

## Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including univariate and bivariate analyses  
- Model training and evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics  
- Dynamic comparison of all models in a clear tabular format
